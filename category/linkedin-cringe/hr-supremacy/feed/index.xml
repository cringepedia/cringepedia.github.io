<h2>Origin</h2>



<p>The cringe seems to be originated from indian linkedin, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6779977272154828800/?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6779977272154828800%29">here</a> the original poster claims he / she owns this cringe, so we assume he/she might be the patient zero</p>

<h2>Mutations</h2>



<p>I have encountered several mutated versions of this cringe while surfing through linkedin</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>UAE version</p><cite>But I know the company gives me freehand for up to 6K AED in hand.<br><br>He was a suitable and perfect match candidate,<br><br>so without any further questions, I sent him an offer letter for a 6K AED per month salary.<br><br>and he thanked me, I can see the happiness in his eyes.<br><br>Companies need to understand that If you pay the employee up to their expectation, they will deliver the result beyond employer expectations.<br><br>Share this so that HR can understand that they don&#8217;t pay salary from their pocket, so stop negotiating with candidates.<br><br>Agree?</cite></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Pakistan version</p><cite>I asked the salary expectation of a candidate.<br>He told me that he is expecting 25K PKR<br><br>But being an HR, I know the company gives me freehand for up to 35K in hand. He was a suitable and perfect match candidate,<br><br>So without any further questions, I sent him an offer letter for 35K PKR per month salary. And he thanked me, I can see the happiness in his eyes.<br><br>Companies need to understand that If you pay the employee up to their expectation, they will deliver the result beyond employer expectations.<br><br>Share this so that HR can understand that they don&#8217;t pay salary from their pocket, so stop negotiating with candidates.<br><br>Agree?</cite></blockquote>



<h2>Why this cringe was probably created ?</h2>



<p>In the previous <a href="https://cringepedia.com/i-interviewed-a-candidate-through-skype-last-week/">article</a> i have mentioned HR&#8217;s aren&#8217;t worshipped enough for their service to the humanity, so my intuition is that, this is another fairy tale to demonstrate the importance of HR in the food chain. The message this cringe delievers is very simple</p>



<pre class="wp-block-verse">HR nOt bAd, HR gOoD,  HR hElP EmPloYeE</pre>



<p>lets keep the satire aside for a moment, if you willingly offer less salary for employee, then this is simply wage theft.</p>
